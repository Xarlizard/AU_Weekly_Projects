# Simple NFT Indexer

This is an skeleton app that uses the Alchemy SDK rigged to Alchemy's Enhanced APIs in order to display all of an address's ERC-721 tokens, including a call to any `image` attached to their metadata.

## Set Up

1. Create a `.env` file on the root folder with the variable "VITE_API_KEY=" and then place your alchemy api key
2. Install dependencies by running `npm install`
3. Start application by running `npm run dev`

## Challenge

Fork this repo and build out more features! This is minimalistic on purpose.
